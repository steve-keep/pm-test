# ProdMill Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Technology Stack
This project uses Next.js, TypeScript, React Testing Library, and Vitest. All new development must conform to this stack.

### II. Code Quality
ESLint and Prettier are enforced for code quality and consistency. All code must pass linting and formatting checks before being merged.

### III. Test Coverage
A minimum of 80% unit test coverage and 50% integration test coverage is required. All new features must include tests that meet these standards.

### IV. Test-Driven Development (TDD)
Test-Driven Development is mandatory. Tests must be written before implementation, and the Red-Green-Refactor cycle must be followed.

### V. Pull Request Guidelines
All pull requests must reference the issue they are addressing to ensure automatic closure and proper tracking.

## Development Workflow

The development workflow is centered around a TDD approach, with a strong emphasis on code quality and testing. All changes are introduced through pull requests, which are reviewed and tested before being merged.

## Governance
This constitution is the single source of truth for the project's development standards. Any proposed changes must be reviewed and approved by the project maintainers.
